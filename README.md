In this work,  we propose a novel effective approach to address the blur detection problem from a single image without requiring any knowledge about the blur type, level, or camera settings. Our approach computes blur detection maps based on a novel High-frequency multiscale Fusion and Sort Transform (HiFST) of gradient magnitudes.
